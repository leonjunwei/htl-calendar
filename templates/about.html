    	<p>This app was made with <b>love</b> and <b>care</b> by Leon Lam (Olin College '19) and Emily Yeh (Olin College '19) for Olin's Spring 2017 <em>Hacking the Library</em> course. The calendar is still a work in progress, but we hope it will be improved and useful to Oliners in the future.

    	<br/><br/>

    	In terms of future work, it would be great if the following features were added to this app:

    	<br/>

    	&diams; Manually or automatically import/export events from mailing lists<br/>
    	&diams; Search database for events by time ("after 6:00", "before 23:00", etc.) <br/>
    	&diams; Search database for events by tags ("carpe", "dance", etc.)
    	</p>
    	</div>
